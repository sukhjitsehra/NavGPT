Project Instructions
==============================
# Install the packages
Locate to the downloaded zip file or git clone on VScode or terminal
cmd - npm install 

# Download android studio
Install latest android studio version and don't forget to install the emulator in the android studio
- If you are using a physical device don't forget to switch on the debugging developer mode on your phone

# To run the code on android device or emulator
- Run Windows Powershell in administrator
- Locate to the directory of the project
- Then run the cmd
  -  npx react-native run-android
- This will open node.js server and start building and install apk in your emulator or Physical device

# You need to Signup or Login in the app
- password should be atleast 6 character
- After Signup it will redirect you to login

# Create a .env file 
- chatgpt_api_key = your_api_key
- weather_api_key = your_api_key
- graphhopper_api_key = your_api_key
- mapbox_api_key = your_api_key

# To run the python Pollution and the Crime Routeserver
- You can run it on external server or Terminal, these files is located in chatGPT/PollutionCrimeTraffic folder
- To connect the to the app you need to run the file in externel server
- To run and check on terminal
  - locate the terminal to chatGPT/PollutionCrimeTraffic folder
  - then run the command
    - $ python app.py
  - then it will start running on one of the port use the following link with the parameters
      - Example API Request
        To request a route from your API with specific parameters, you can use the following example:

        http://127.0.0.1:3001/api?origin_lat=43.465187&origin_lon=-80.52237&destination_lat=43.647938&destination_lon=-79.38355&mode=car&route_mode=crimeroute
        
        Parameters:

      - origin_lat - Latitude of the origin point (e.g., 43.465187).
      - origin_lon - Longitude of the origin point (e.g., -80.52237).
      - destination_lat - Latitude of the destination point (e.g., 43.647938).
      - destination_lon - Longitude of the destination point (e.g., -79.38355).
      - mode - Transportation mode, in this case, car.
      - route_mode - Specifies the type of route; example, 'crimeroute', 'pollutionroute', 'trafficroute'.
