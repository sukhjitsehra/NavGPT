- [ ] Continue to work on research article/blogs on how to achieve this objectives.
- [ ] ~~**Stuck on** the Deployment the opensource application select that suits the needs (Check for the possibilities to add LLM).~~
    -    ~~Look at Map APIs (shortest path APIs, OSRM for OSM)~~
    -    Look at OpenAI APIs for LLM models
    -    ~~Create or Use existing OSS code to create the Mobile app page to interact with the user to get the start and the end point. ~~
    -    ~~Then call API to give the short possible route and start navigating through (this feature can be taken from the existing map).~~
          - ~~Map rendering and navigation process.~~
- [ ] improving on errors.
- [ ] Alternative path selection on map.
- [ ] Direction Instructions on map.
- [ ] Add Car Symbology.
- [ ] Rough ideas on the timelines.

- [ ] Look for research article/blogs on how to achieve this objectives.
- [ ] Deploy the opensource application select that suits the needs (Check for the possibilities to Add LLM).
- [ ] ~~Learn about the fine tuning the LLM models.~~
- [ ] Rough ideas on the timelines.

## Date - May 3, 2024

-  [ ] The topic selected is buidling mobile navgational app that includes LLM for commiunicating with the User (*considering the hold of the technology stack and experience to build movbile applications of the student).
-  [ ] Look for research article/blogs on how to achieve this objectives.
-  [ ] ~~Selecting the technology stack for Open source navigational application. The development should use OSM as backend/platform.~~
-  [ ] ~~Need to study some routing engine implementations.~~
-  [ ] Rough ideas on the timelines.

## Date - 30/04/2024
- [ ] To do the research on selecting the topic of interest: 
    
    - [ ] vehicle-to-vehicle (directions) communication and navigational method, which can include the integration with LLM models with spatial data
    - [ ] outdoor smart and navigation
    - [ ] Mobile application development: There are few opensource applications on Navigation using OSM that can be explored.
    -  [ ] Install some of the app that you, OSMAND, maps.me, paid versions. 
        - I have the engine for routing, OSRM and Valhala, deployed. 
        - Crete multi-point picks and drops off LLM.
